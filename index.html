        <h1>DO LUXURY GOODS FOLLOW THE LAW OF DEMAND</h1>
        <hr>
        <div>
        <h2 id="home">Demand</h2>
        <h>In microeconomics, demand is referred to as the <b>quantity of product or service that the consumers are willing to purchase at a particular price level.</b>  We also call it <b>ceteris paribus</b>. This ceteris paribus acts as a shorthand indication of the effect of one economic variable.<br>
          The quantity demanded by the consumers also depends on their ability to pay.A person who has the ability to buy and willing to pay for that product only can be called as demand. 
          The major factor in demand is the opportunity to buy. Economists do not define how a person will pay for an item, they can pay with cash, check, credit card, money borrowed from friends, loan or taken from the piggy bank.
           </h>
          </div>
          <h3>Types of Demand</h3>
          <h4>1. Individual Demand</h4>
          <k>It is from a single consumer where he or she demand for goods and services 
          </k>
          <h4>2. Market Demand</h4>
          <k>It is a horizontal summation of all individuals in a market.</k>
          <h3>Law Of Demand</h3>
          <c>The law of demand states that the quantity demanded of a good shows an inverse relationship with the price of a good when other factors are held constant (cetris peribus). It means that as the price increases, demand decreases.
          </c>
          <img>
          <h3>Graphical Representation</h3>
          <c>The graphical representation of the law of demand is a curve that establishes the relationship between the quantity demanded and the price of a good.
            The shape of the demand curve can vary among different types of goods. Most frequently, the demand curve shows a concave shape. However, in many economics textbooks, we can also see the demand curve as a straight line.
            </c>
            <h3>Price Elasticity Of Demand</h3>
            <d>The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price.
              Luxury goods have high-income elasticity of demand: as people become wealthier, they will buy proportionately more luxury goods. This also means, however, that should there be a decline in income, its demand will drop more than proportionately.
              </d>
              <h2 id="lgoods">Luxury goods</h2>
              <e>In economics, a luxury good (or upmarket good) is a good for which demand increases more than what is proportional as income rises, so that expenditures on the good become a greater proportion of overall spending.Luxury goods are in contrast to necessity goods, where demand increases proportionally less than income.</e>
          <h2 id="vgoods">Veblen goods</h2>
          <f>Certain types of luxury goods violate the law of demand.These are called Veblen Goods.Veblen goods are products that increase in demand as the price rises, resulting in an upward sloping demand curve instead of a downward sloping demand curve. Some examples of Veblen goods include luxury cars, expensive wines, and designer clothes.</f>
          <h3>Example: I-phone</h3>
          <g>• iPhone is a chain of smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It can be a perfect example of a Veblen good because more than the phone’s quality of services, it is purchased for its image associated with prestige.
            • Phone sales have consistently made up about 60% of Apple’s revenue.
            </g>
            <h5>REASONS</h5>
            <h6>1.Perception of quality</h6>
            <i>Higher price of a product is perceived as an indication of it’s higher quality.</i>
            <h3>Example: Whiskey-Chivas Regal</h3>
            <j> A famous example of this comes from the whiskey brand Chivas Regal. Chivas Regal struggled to sell their product when they initially launched, however they decided to raise their price. Keeping all things constant except the new higher price, Chivas Regal had an explosion of sales. People were drawn to Chivas Reglas because they assumed it must be higher quality with a high price tag, and it resulted in more demand with an increased price.</j>
            <h6>2.Positional goods</h6>
            <i>Status symbols are the second main reason why people are attracted to Veblen goods. Since Veblen goods are tied to conspicuous consumption, a higher price is something that is unachievable for the masses</i>
            <h3>Example: Car-Ferrari</h3>
            <j>A Ferrari isn’t only an incredible car, it’s also something that is out of reach for a majority of the world. By owning a Ferrari, it places people into a different social class and that is directly a result of the high price. The more people who are hoping to be perceived as in a high social class, the more demand there is for cars.</j>
